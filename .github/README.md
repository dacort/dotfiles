My (n)ever-changing dotfiles / bare git style

## Overview

I've tried a few variations of dotfiles in the past, but I never really liked having to manage my config files with more code.

So in hunting around for solutions (and trying `yadm` as well) I came across the [git bare repo](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles) approach.

I quite liked it, so this is my attempt at managing my dotfiles across 1-n machines where currently `n=2`.
